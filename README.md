# YouTube Insight Analyzer

## Project Description and Objectives

This project aims to analyze YouTube comments, video metadata, and transcripts. The main objectives are:
- Categorize comments by sentiment, themes, and reasoning patterns.
- Identify echo chambers and polarizing language in political content.

## Installation Instructions

To install the required dependencies, run the following command:
```bash
pip install requests pandas numpy matplotlib transformers youtube-transcript-api openai langchain plotly websockets
```

## Usage Instructions

1. **Setup YouTube API integration for data collection.**
2. **Build a function for comment scraping and storing in a structured format (CSV/JSON).**
3. **Create a module for sentiment analysis using VADER or HuggingFace transformers.**
4. **Develop a script for transcribing YouTube videos using Whisper.**
5. **Visualize data insights using `matplotlib` and save results as graphs.**
6. **Test the system on left-wing and right-wing political content (e.g., HasanAbi, Ben Shapiro).**
7. **Document the process and create reusable modules for other platforms.**

## Incorporating User Feedback

To incorporate user feedback into the sentiment analysis, follow these steps:

1. **Collect Feedback**: Gather feedback from users regarding the accuracy and relevance of the sentiment analysis results.
2. **Update Sentiment Data**: Use the feedback to update the sentiment data and improve the analysis accuracy.
3. **Save Updated Data**: Save the updated sentiment data to a CSV file for future use.

### Example: Inputting URLs and User Feedback

#### Inputting URLs

To input a URL for analysis, use the following endpoint in the web UI:

```http
POST /input-url
Content-Type: application/json

{
  "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=example_video_id"
}
```

This will process the URL, scrape the comments, perform sentiment analysis, and save the results.

#### Providing User Feedback

To provide user feedback, use the following endpoint in the web UI:

```http
POST /user-feedback
Content-Type: application/json

{
  "feedback": {
    "comment_id": "example_comment_id",
    "corrected_sentiment": "positive"
  }
}
```

This will incorporate the feedback into the sentiment analysis and update the sentiment data.

### Saving Data in CSV Format

To save data in CSV format, use the following endpoint in the web UI:

```http
POST /save-csv
Content-Type: application/json

{
  "data": [
    {
      "comment": "example_comment",
      "vader_sentiment": {"neg": 0.1, "neu": 0.8, "pos": 0.1, "compound": 0.0},
      "hf_sentiment": {"label": "neutral", "score": 0.8}
    }
  ],
  "filename": "output.csv"
}
```

This will save the provided data to a CSV file with the specified filename.
